# Olympic-Games-Power-BI-Project
🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project!

I just wrapped up an Olympic Games Dashboard in Power BI for 2025, and I couldn’t be prouder of the results. This project was built from scratch, starting with raw data in a CSV file, and transformed into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. Here’s what I focused on:

**🏋️‍♂️ From CSV to Dashboard:**
I loaded Olympic Games data into Power BI, cleaned and prepped it, and designed visuals to provide actionable insights.

**🎨 Dynamic Visualizations:**
Designed engaging charts, tables, and KPIs to showcase medal counts, country performance, and athlete statistics.

**📊 In-Depth Analysis:**
Tracked metrics like medal distribution by country, athlete achievements, and trends by sport, gender, and age.

**💡 Key Insights:**
The United States leads in overall medals.

Michael Phelps remains the top Olympic medalist with 28 medals.

Most medals are earned by athletes aged 20-30.

**💻 Takeaways:**
This project highlights how Power BI can turn raw data into meaningful stories, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
